# MVVM-Router
Sample of `MVVM Architecture` with adding `Router` component.


# Router Role
When the user taps the next button to navigate to the next scene in the storyboard, a segue is trigged and a new view controller is presented. A router extracts this navigation logic out of the view controller. It is also the best place to pass any data to the next scene. As a result, the view controller is left with just the task of controlling views.
